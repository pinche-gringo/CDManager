How to build the CDManager
--------------------------

  Basically with the GNU mantra:

    ./configure
    make

  See the file INSTALL for more details.


Setting up the database
-----------------------

  MySQL should be already running. Consult your local documentation
  how to setup and configure it.

  The database can be created by running

    make createDB

  the SQL directory. You are prompted to enter the root password and
  the database is created.

  For security reasons I recommend to define a dedicated user to run
  the application. This is beyond the scope of this document; see the
  MySQL documentation for how to do so.


Changing the genres of records/movies
-------------------------------------

  The file "Genres.dat" in the "data" directory contains the genres of
  both records and movies (as I use them). The syntax is like those of
  INI-file and should be self-explainatory.

  Note that one should not change the numbers for any genre, as they
  are used in the database to define its assigned genre.

  After changing the file it must be installed (by make install in the
  data directory).


Changing the sort order of the entries
--------------------------------------

  The program tries to sort the entries in a human-like way. To do so,
  it first tries to remove a single leading article and then any
  leading first names (except if this would remove the last word).

  This should lead to a list sorted by sure names or - in case of
  groups - to names having the articles stripped of.

  To be able to do so, the program needs to know, what articles and
  first names are. They can be added via the settings dialog (and are
  stored in the database).

  The SQl directory contains a file (populateDB.sql) which pre-fills
  the database with english, german and spanish articles and a few
  first names. Load it into the database with

    make populateDB

  in the SQL directory. Note that this needs a (MySQL) user called
  cdmgr, for which password you are prompted.


Exporting the database to HTML documents
